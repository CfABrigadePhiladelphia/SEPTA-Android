<html><head><title>Next To Arrive</title></head><body><div><ul> <li><p class='indent'>SEPTA operates 13 rail lines that travel to destinations across the region. Some of these trains operate on SEPTA controlled track and some on Amtrak territory. Our Regional Rail Control Center can 'see' all of the trains traveling on SEPTA territory in real time, so the status information posted on TrainView is also in real time. Train status for service originating from Amtrak territory - Newark, DE (WIL), Trenton , NJ, (TRE) and Thorndale (PAO) - is estimated times, since the Control Center cannot 'see' the actual movement of these trains. When the Control Center receives updated reports about these trains that information is published on TrainView.</p></li> <li><p class='indent'>In the event of a significant delay on a regularly scheduled train you may see the word 'SUSPEND' in the status column. This may mean the train is temporarily canceled while we work on a problem or it may mean the train will not continue operation. In that case, you may see a listing for another train with a different origination point and the same train number with a 'P' after it, i.e., 6353P. The 'P' means that SEPTA has sent another train to pick up customers to complete the original train's journey. If a train has been 'suspended' it will not appear as the second train of a connecting trip</p></li> </ul> </div></body></html>
